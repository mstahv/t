This tutorial gives you an overview how you can use
https://vaadin.com/framework[Vaadin Framework] to build web UI's for your Java
applications. All you need to start with is a JDK 8 and an IDE like Eclipse.
Only basic programming skills are required. Although the tutorial is built for
Eclipse users, you can use your IDE of choice and adapt the different parts to
your IDE.

We'll build a simple customer management system. It is not a real app, but we'll
use an in-memory "backend" so that you can understand how could hook it to an
existing Java based backend. We'll mostly cover basic Vaadin development and you
can use the result as a basis for more experiments with Vaadin like using
add-ons, your own custom theme, adding new views or optimising the result for
mobile support.

The tutorial uses Java 8, so ensure you have an up to date JDK 8 installed. Most
linux distributions can use package managers to install JDK8, others should
download it from
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Oracle's Java
SE site].

Also make sure you have the latest version of your IDE. Eclipse is available in
various packages, be sure to download the *Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers*
from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/[eclipse.org].

== Creating a project using an archetype

As a starting point for the application we'll use a Maven archetype called
vaadin-archetype-application. Maven archetypes are projects stubs with basic
build script and some example code.

Start by choosing menu:File[New > Maven Project] from the menu.

image::createMavenProject.jpg[Create a new Maven built Vaadin project.]

TIP: If the "Maven Project" is not visible in the menu, you should switch to
_Java EE_ perspective. Use the shortcut button in the toolbar or
menu:Window[Perspective] to do this.

The first page in the wizard is ok with its defaults, but on the second page
you'll need to choose _vaadin-archetype-application_ archetype. You can first
try to find it using the filtering function, but in some cases Eclipse hasn't
yet indexed the archetype catalog, so you might need to manually add the
archetype details with the _Add Archetype_ button. The Group Id is _com.vaadin_,
the Artifact Id is _vaadin-archetype-application_ and as a version you can use
the latest Vaadin version, at the time of writing _7.6.1_. The _Repository URL_
can be left blank.

CAUTION: Eclipse has a nasty bug in its project wizard. If the
_vaadin-archetype-application_ don't appear in the listing, even though you
added it using the _Add Archetype_ button, close the whole new project wizard
and re-open it by selecting menu:File[New > Maven Project] again. The archetype
then typically appears in the listing properly and can be found by the filtering
functionality.

On the next wizard page, type in _my.vaadin_ as the Group Id, _app_ as the
Artifact Id and click _Finish_. If this is your first ever Vaadin app, creating
a project might take a while, depending of the speed of your network, as Vaadin
libraries and other dependencies are being downloaded. Maven caches these on
your local file system and creating your next Vaadin project will be much
faster.

Right click on the newly created project and choose menu:Run as[Maven Install].
This will initiate a full build of your application and will finally create a
war file to the "target" directory that you can deploy to your application
server. As Maven might again need to download some new modules and the project
has a setup for add-on usage and contains a project specific theme, the first
build will take a while.

While the build is running, let's have a look at what the archetype created for
you. You can browse your project resources from the tree structure in the
_Project Explorer_. The _pom.xml_ on top level contains settings for your
projects build and declares the used dependencies. Open _Java Resources_ and
below it _src/main/java_, the main source directory, and _my.vaadin.app_, the
main Java package that will contain your Vaadin UI code.

TIP: Eclipse shows all project files in the Project Explorer. In this case you
can also find you _.java_ files via top level _src_ node, but the suggested
method is to access them via _Java Resources_ node, which is optimised for
editing Java source code.

The UI code (and the Servlet declaration) used by the application stub can be
found in the _MyUI.java_ file. Let's read it through to see how it works. The
_init_ method of a UI class is triggered when a user enters your web
application. The VerticalLayout is one of the most used layout objects, which
are used to position and display other Vaadin components in your UI classes. The
example code creates one TextField to allow user to input his/her name and a
Button whose click listener dynamically adds a new Label component to the main
layout. In the end of the init method we just configure the main layout and
place components into it and set it to be the content of the MyUI.

To test your first Vaadin application, right click on the project and choose
menu:Debug as[Maven build...]. Debug mode is slightly slower than basic run
mode, but it often helps you to figure out what is happening in your
application.

image::debugAsMavenBuild.jpg[Starting server using Maven target]

In the dialog, type _Run in jetty_ to the _Name_ input and _jetty:run_ to the
_Goals_ input.

image::debugAsMavenBuild2.jpg[Generating a Maven launch for jetty:run target]

Before clicking debug, to make sure debugging works properly, add your Java
project to the source lookup path from the _Source_ tab, like it is being done
in the image below.

image::debugAsMavenBuildAddSources.jpg[Adding sources for debugging]

Now click _Debug_ to continue. This will download a small Java web server 
(if not cached to your local Maven repository), and use it to host
your application. Once the server has started, point your browser to the URL
http://localhost:8080/[http://localhost:8080/] to see the running application.

If you make changes to the code, the jetty server will notice the changes and in
a couple of seconds most changes are automatically deployed. Reloading the page
in browser will show the changes.

TIP: In some cases your JVM might not allow injecting changes on the fly. In
these cases Eclipse will complain about "Hot code replacement error". Just
choose to restart the server to get the latest changes. Many Java developers use
a tool called http://zeroturnaround.com/software/jrebel/[JRebel] to make code
replacement work better.

Mastering the usage of debugger is also handy to better understand how your
application actually works and fixing bugs that all developers write at some
point. Double click on the line number in the Java editor, for example of the
following line in the click listener:

[source,java]
----
    layout.addComponent(new Label("Thanks " + name.getValue()
----

This will add a breakpoint to the selected line. If you then click the button in
your browser, the execution of the application will stop on the line. Eclipse
will ask you to enter to _Debugging perspective_ and you can inspect its
variables and step through the execution. Clicking on the _play_ icon in the
toolbar will continue the execution. Double click the same line again to remove
the breakpoint.

image::debugInBreakPointVariable.jpg[Execution in a break point in the button click listener]

Clicking the red square in the Console view will terminate the server process.
You can restart it easily form the run/debug history. You can find that from the
small down arrow next to the green play button or bug button (for the debug
mode) in the toolbar. Alternatively you can use the main menu: menu:Run[Run
history/Debug history > Run in Jetty].

To get back to the _Java EE Perspective_, an Eclipse mode designed for editing
Java web app code, click the _Java EE_ button on the toolbar.

== Adding a demo "backend"

Before getting more into real Vaadin development, let's introduce some domain
objects and a "fake backend". In a real world application you'll most likely
have something similar, implemented with for example JPA and EJB or Spring based
service.

Copy the following three classes from the github to your project. Class names
point to the classes hosted in Github. Copying classes can be done in many ways.

TIP: The fastest way to copy classes using Eclipse is to use your good old
clipboard. Select the text content of the whole class from your browser, choose
menu:Edit[Copy], focus the node representing the _my.vaadin.app_ Java package in
Eclipse's Java Resources view and choose menu:Edit[Paste]. Eclipse is smart
enough to automatically create a properly named Java file for the class.

 * https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstahv/t/master/src/main/java/my/vaadin/app/CustomerStatus.java[CustomerStatus] - this is a simple enum class
 * https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstahv/t/master/src/main/java/my/vaadin/app/Customer.java[Customer] - this is the main domain object, a basic Java bean, that we'll be
   using in our example
 * https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstahv/t/master/src/main/java/my/vaadin/app/CustomerService.java[CustomerService] - this is a simple facade via you can request and modify Customer instances. You can think of this as your entry point to your fake database.

In the next steps we'll be using these classes and build a UI around them. The
actual implementation of these classes is not relevant for this tutorial, but
feel free to have a look around.

== Listing entities in a Grid

Often when you start building a UI for a data centric application, the first
thing you want to do is to list your data from your backend. There are several
components and methods in Vaadin to do this. In this example we'll use the Grid
component for tabular presentation of our customers.

We'll start by introducing a Grid field to the MyUI class. We could of course
just introduce the Grid as a variable in the init method, but we'll most likely
want to refer to it later. Also, let's get a reference to the CustomerService.

[source,java]
----
public class MyUI extends UI {

    // Add next two lines:
    private CustomerService service = CustomerService.getInstance();
    private Grid grid = new Grid();

    // the rest is already there...
    @Override
    protected void init(VaadinRequest vaadinRequest) {
----

TIP: If you are new to Java development, you probably don't feel comfortable
with the a red compilation error for the line where the Grid got introduced, due
to a missing import. This is easily fixed in Eclipse by using the
menu:Source[Organize Imports] command. Learn its shortcut (kbd:[Ctrl-Shift-O] or
kbd:[CMD-Shift-O] on Macs), you'll be using it a lot in Java development. In
possible class name collisions, always choose the appropriate class from the
_com.vaadin.ui_ package if you want to import core Vaadin UI classes like the
Grid.

To simply list all properties of all Customer objects from the backend service,
replace the init method with following snippet:

[source,java]
----
@Override
protected void init(VaadinRequest vaadinRequest) {
    final VerticalLayout layout = new VerticalLayout();

    // add Grid to the layout
    layout.addComponents(grid);

    // fetch list of Customers from service and assign it to Grid
    List<Customer> customers = service.findAll();
    grid.setContainerDataSource(new BeanItemContainer<>(Customer.class, customers));

    layout.setMargin(true);
    setContent(layout);
}
----

TIP: Again, use the organize imports feature. The List object we use here is
_java.util.List_.

As we'll want to refresh the listing from various places in our application,
extract the customer listing part into its own "updateList" method with the
*public* modifier. The public modifier is handy later when we want to update the
listing from other classes. You can let Eclipse help here by selecting the
relevant lines and using the "quick fix" feature (kbd:[Ctrl+1] or kbd:[Cmd+1] on
Macs). The extracted method call looks like this:

[source,java]
----
	public void updateList() {
		List<Customer> customers = service.findAll(filterText.getValue());
		grid.setContainerDataSource(new BeanItemContainer<>(Customer.class, customers));
	}
----

If you try the application now, you'll see that quite many properties of the
customers are shown in the grid. To limit the visible properties configure
the Grid using the _setColumns_ method to only show "firstName", "lastName" and
"email" properties.

[source,java]
----
    grid.setColumns("firstName", "lastName", "email");
----

At this point the body of the MyUI class should look like this (servlet declaration
omitted):

[source,java]
----
private CustomerService service = CustomerService.getInstance();
private Grid grid = new Grid();

@Override
protected void init(VaadinRequest vaadinRequest) {
    final VerticalLayout layout = new VerticalLayout();

    grid.setColumns("firstName", "lastName", "email");
    // add Grid to the layout
    layout.addComponent(grid);

    updateList();

    layout.setMargin(true);
    setContent(layout);
}

public void updateList() {
    // fetch list of Customers from service and assign it to Grid
    List<Customer> customers = service.findAll();
    grid.setContainerDataSource(new BeanItemContainer<>(Customer.class, customers));
}
----

You can now save your changes the file and verify you changes from your browser.
You can do this at any point you want during the rest of the tutorial as well.

== Creating live filtering for entities

A proper search functionality is expected in every modern application and it is
also a nice Vaadin development exercise. Let's add a filtering functionality to
the Customer listing we created in the previous step.

We'll start by introducing a TextField component as a field to our UI class:

[source,java]
----
    private TextField filterText = new TextField();
----

In the _init_ method, configure the text field to contain a helpful input prompt
and add a text change listener to the field. The exact place of these lines is
not important, but add them for example after you have introduced the _layout_
object.

[source,java]
----
filterText.setInputPrompt("filter by name...");
filterText.addTextChangeListener(e -> {
    grid.setContainerDataSource(new BeanItemContainer<>(Customer.class,
            service.findAll(e.getText())));
});
----

TIP: To keep your code more readable, you can use autoformat after you write or
copy paste code snippets. The default keyboard shortcut in Eclipse is
kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+F] or kbd:[Cmd+Shift+F]

The text change listener is another listener (in addition to more the commonly
used ValueChangeListener) you can use it with text fields in Vaadin. It is fired
lazily while the user is typing, but only when there is a small pause in the
typing. This makes it perfect for this kind of automatic filtering. When the
user has changed the text, we'll just update the listing like in the updateList
method, but use the current text as a filter for entries.

To keep the _updateList_ method functional, it should also take into
consideration a possible value in the filterText field. Change the line for
fetching the customers into this:

[source,java]
----
  List<Customer> customers = service.findAll(filterText.getValue());
----

Before adding the plain text field to the UI, let's improve the usability a bit
and make a short exercise to compose better components from low level Vaadin
components. The search field can naturally be cleared with keyboard, but lets
add a clear button next to the text field. Start by adding the following lines
to the init method, for example right after your filterText configuration:

[source,java]
----
Button clearFilterTextBtn = new Button(FontAwesome.TIMES);
clearFilterTextBtn.setDescription("Clear the current filter");
clearFilterTextBtn.addClickListener(e -> {
  filterText.clear();
  updateList();
});
----

Vaadin contains a set of built in icons, from which we here use the "X" icon,
_FontAwesome.TIMES_, which most users will recognise as a functionality to clear
the value. If we set the description to a component, it will be shown as a
tooltip for those users who hover the mouse over the button and wonder what to
do with it. In the click listener we simply clear the text from the field and
refresh the content of the listing.

Vaadin contains lots of different kinds of layouts. The simplest way to align
the text field and the button next to each other would be to use a
HorizontalLayout. An alternative way we use here is using a CssLayout, which is
a lightweight layout that is easy to customize with css. Even if you wouldn't
want to play with CSS yourself, you can many times use one of the existing style
rules in the default _Valo_ theme. The following snippet will create a nice
compact "composition" of both the TextField and the clear button. Add these
lines to the init method right after you configured the _clearFilterTextBtn_:

[source,java]
----
CssLayout filtering = new CssLayout();
filtering.addComponents(filterText, clearFilterTextBtn);
filtering.setStyleName(ValoTheme.LAYOUT_COMPONENT_GROUP);
----

Finally, *change* the row in the init method, that currently adds only the grid,
to add both _filtering_ composition and the _grid_ to the main _layout_ of the
application.

[source,java]
----
    layout.addComponents(filtering, grid);
----

It is now a good place to save your changes and try them via browser.

== Creating a form using Vaadin Designer

The form to edit Customer objects can be build using several methods of which
visual composition by drag 'n' drop is the most intuitive. Vaadin
Designer is an Eclipse plugin that you can install and do WYSIWYG editing of
your view code. We'll use it to create the form and then hook the editing logic
to it with Java.

TIP: If you are using another IDE or just prefer to compose your user interface
with code, take the alternative step, <<Creating a form using plain Java>>,
where the CustomerForm is composed using plain Java code.

=== Installing Vaadin Designer

Vaadin Designer comes as an integrated part of Vaadin Plugin for Eclipse. It can
be installed easily via Eclipse Marketplace. Choose menu:Help[Eclipse Marketplace]

In the dialog, just search for Vaadin and click _install_ to mark it for 
installation. Clicking _Install Now_ will take you to choose the modules you want
and accept the license agreement.

image::pluginEclipseMarketPlace2.jpg[Selecting Vaadin Plugin for Eclipse for 
installation in Eclipse Marketplace]

TIP: When you actually use the Vaadin Designer for the first time in the next step,
it will ask for a license key. If you are not willing to buy license now, just
acquire a trial license.

=== Creating the form design

The following screencast will show you how to produce the 
_CustomerFormDesign.html_, a design file we need in this tutorial. Use pause and
slow motion to better follow what is being done on the video. 

video::doKj0JwXWrI[youtube, width="640", height="400"]

TIP: At any point of the process you can also switch to the markup mode where
you can edit the raw content of the .html file. If you wish to take a shortcut
or think you did something wrong when using the designer, you can just 
copy-paste the content of the final state to your own .html file.

At this point we only have a static mockup of the actual UI. To implement a
functional form component, we need some Java code as well. Vaadin Designer
automatically creates a similarly named Java class, but a good habit with
Vaadin Designer is to never touch the auto-generated file, in this case the
CustomerFormDesign.java file. If you'd introduce a new field to your form, 
your changes to CustomerFormDesign would be overridden by the tooling. Instead
we'll create a class called CustomerForm which inherits from the auto-generated
CustomerFormDesign class.

Start by creating a new Java class with the name CustomerForm. In Eclipse right
click on the "my.vaadin.app" package and choose menu:New[Class]. Type in the
name _CustomerForm_, define the super class as 
_my.vaadin.app.CustomerFormDesign_ and click _finish_.

From the superclass we inherit all the UI elements that we named when using
the designer. E.g. by simply referencing to "save" field in the CustomerForm,
we'll have access to the save button we previously created.

We will later need a reference to the currently edited Customer object,
CustomerService and the MyUI that uses this class. Add these fields and a
basic constructor that accepts MyUI as a parameter to the CustomerForm class:

[source,java]
----
CustomerService service = CustomerService.getInstance();
private Customer customer;
private MyUI parent;

public CustomerForm(MyUI myUI) {
    this.parent = myUI;
}
----

Although the form is not yet fully functional, you might want to see how it 
looks like at this point. Add it as a field to the _MyUI_ class:

[source,java]
----
    CustomerForm form = new CustomerForm(this);
----

Now let's modify the init method in MyUI to show the form. Let's wrap both the
Grid and the CustomerForm in a horizontal layout and configure the Grid to use
all of the available space more efficiently. Replace the line
*layout.addComponents(filtering, grid);* with the following:

[source,java]
----
HorizontalLayout main = new HorizontalLayout(grid, form);
main.setSpacing(true);
main.setSizeFull();
grid.setSizeFull();
main.setExpandRatio(grid, 1);

layout.addComponents(filtering, main);
----

If you now save your changes and and reload your application page in browser,
you should see your work in progress CustomerForm next to the grid listing your
existing entities.

Let's get back to the CustomerForm. The first thing we'll need is to populate
the options for the select. To add all enum values as valid selections, add the
following line to the constructor:

[source,java]
----
    status.removeAllItems(); // Remove demo data assigned by Designer
    status.addItems(CustomerStatus.values());
----

Let's also improve the UX a bit. When building the design, we already 
emphasised the save button with a ValoTheme.BUTTON_PRIMARY style name. Thus, it
would be natural if a hit to enter key would do the same action as clicking the
save button. Give the save button a keyboard shortcut with this line to the
constructor:

[source,java]
----
save.setClickShortcut(KeyCode.ENTER);
----

To finish our form we need to create a public API, that we will use in the next
part from the MyUI, to pass in a Customer object that the form should edit. We
will also add some logic to actually save the changes. We'll start by creating a
setter method for the Customer field. Just type _setCus_ in the body of the
class and hit autocomplete (kbd:[Ctrl+Space]) and Eclipse will create a method
stub for you. Complete it with following implementation:

[source,java]
----
public void setCustomer(Customer customer) {
    this.customer = customer;
    BeanFieldGroup.bindFieldsUnbuffered(customer, this);

    // Show delete button for only customers already in the database
    delete.setVisible(customer.isPersisted());
    setVisible(true);
    firstName.selectAll();
}
----

In addition to saving the reference of currently edited Customer object, we are
calling _BeanFieldGroup.bindFieldsUnbuffered_ method. It will initialise all
similarly named editor fields in this form with the values from their
counterpart in the given Customer object. Also it will automatically update the
values in the domain objects as the corresponding field value changes in the
user interface.

TIP: If the naming convention based databinding doesn't fit for your needs, you
can use
https://www.vaadin.com/api/com/vaadin/data/fieldgroup/PropertyId.html[PropertyId]
annotation on fields to explicitly declare the edited property.

We'll also want to ensure the form is visible and that the focus goes to the
firstName field to improve the user experience. As we will be using the form to
edit both new non-persisted objects and existing customers, we will also show
the delete button only for customers that are already persisted in the backend.

The last thing we need to do is to handle save and delete button clicks. Add
the following methods to the CustomerForm class:

[source,java]
----
private void delete() {
    service.delete(customer);
    myUI.updateList();
    setVisible(false);
}

private void save() {
    service.save(customer);
    myUI.updateList();
    setVisible(false);
}
----

Finally we'll add listeners to the buttons to call these methods. Adding these
simple lambda expression to the constructor will take care of that:

[source,java]
----
save.addClickListener(e->this.save());
delete.addClickListener(e->this.delete());
----

TIP: For a truly re-usable form component in a real life project, you'd want to
introduce an interface to replace the myUI field or, event better, use an event
system like https://vaadin.com/wiki/-/wiki/main/Events+and+contexts[CDI events]
to completely decouple the components. We'll leave that out of this tutorial for
simplicity.

== Creating a form using plain Java

This is an alternative step to the <<Creating a form using Vaadin Designer>>,
where you'll build the form UI programmatically in plain Java.

Start by creating a new Java class with the name CustomerForm. In Eclipse right
click on the "my.vaadin.app" package and choose menu:New[Class]. Type in the
name _CustomerForm_, define the super class as _com.vaadin.ui.FormLayout_ and
click _finish_.

In the form we'll need editor fields for each property in our Customer domain
class. There are different kinds of fields in Vaadin for editing different kinds
of properties. In this example we'll use a TextField, a PopupDateField and a
NativeSelect. Add the following field declarations and action buttons as Java
fields to the CustomerForm:

[source,java]
----
private TextField firstName = new TextField("First name");
private TextField lastName = new TextField("Last name");
private TextField email = new TextField("Email");
private NativeSelect status = new NativeSelect("Status");
private PopupDateField birthdate = new PopupDateField("Birthday");
private Button save = new Button("Save");
private Button delete = new Button("Delete");
----

We will later also need a reference to the currently edited Customer object,
CustomerService and the MyUI that uses this class. Add these fields and a
basic constructor that accepts MyUI as a parameter to the CustomerForm class:

[source,java]
----
private CustomerService service = CustomerService.getInstance();
private Customer customer;
private MyUI myUI;

public CustomerForm(MyUI myUI) {
    this.myUI = myUI;

    setSizeUndefined();
    HorizontalLayout buttons = new HorizontalLayout(save, delete);
    buttons.setSpacing(true);
    addComponents(firstName, lastName, email, status, birthdate, buttons);
}
----

In the constructor we make the form size undefined, which practically means it
will consume the minimum space defined by its content. Then we'll just add all
fields to the CustomerForm and add action buttons to the bottom - side-by-side
using a HorizontalLayout. Although the form is not yet fully functional, you
might want to see how it looks like at this point. Add it as a field to the MyUI
class:

[source,java]
----
    CustomerForm form = new CustomerForm(this);
----

Now let's modify the init method in MyUI to show the form. Let's wrap both the
Grid and the CustomerForm in a horizontal layout and configure the Grid to use
all of the available space more efficiently. Replace the line
*layout.addComponents(filtering, grid);* with the following:

[source,java]
----
HorizontalLayout main = new HorizontalLayout(grid, form);
main.setSpacing(true);
main.setSizeFull();
grid.setSizeFull();
main.setExpandRatio(grid, 1);

layout.addComponents(filtering, main);
----

If you now save your changes and and reload your application page in browser,
you should see your work in progress CustomerForm next to the grid listing your
existing entities.

Let's get back to the CustomerForm. The first thing we'll need is to populate
the options for the select. To add all enum values as valid selections, add the
following line to the constructor:

[source,java]
----
   status.addItems(CustomerStatus.values());
----

Let's also improve the UX a bit. The most common thing your users will want to
do with this kind of form is to save it. Let's decorate the button with a style
name that makes it more prominent in the UI and give it a keyboard shortcut -
simply an enter hit in this case:

[source,java]
----
save.setStyleName(ValoTheme.BUTTON_PRIMARY);
save.setClickShortcut(KeyCode.ENTER);
----

To finish our form we need to create a public API, that we will use in the next
part from the MyUI, to pass in a Customer object that the form should edit. We
will also add some logic to actually save the changes. We'll start by creating a
setter method for the Customer field. Just type _setCus_ in the body of the
class and hit autocomplete (kbd:[Ctrl+Space]) and Eclipse will create a method
stub for you. Complete it with following implementation:

[source,java]
----
public void setCustomer(Customer customer) {
    this.customer = customer;
    BeanFieldGroup.bindFieldsUnbuffered(customer, this);

    // Show delete button for only customers already in the database
    delete.setVisible(customer.isPersisted());
    setVisible(true);
    firstName.selectAll();
}
----

In addition to saving the reference of currently edited Customer object, we are
calling _BeanFieldGroup.bindFieldsUnbuffered_ method. It will initialise all
similarly named editor fields in this form with the values from their
counterpart in the given Customer object. Also it will automatically update the
values in the domain objects as the corresponding field value changes in the
user interface.

TIP: If the naming convention based databinding doesn't fit for your needs, you
can use
https://www.vaadin.com/api/com/vaadin/data/fieldgroup/PropertyId.html[PropertyId]
annotation on fields to explicitly declare the edited property.

We'll also want to ensure the form is visible and that the focus goes to the
firstName field to improve the user experience. As we will be using the form to
edit both new non-persisted objects and existing customers, we will also show
the delete button only for customers that are already persisted in the backend.

The last thing we need to do is to handle save and delete button clicks. Add
the following methods to the CustomerForm class:

[source,java]
----
private void delete() {
    service.delete(customer);
    myUI.updateList();
    setVisible(false);
}

private void save() {
    service.save(customer);
    myUI.updateList();
    setVisible(false);
}
----

Finally we'll add listeners to the buttons to call these methods. Adding these
simple lambda expression to the constructor will take care of that:

TIP: For a truly re-usable form component in a real life project, you'd want to
introduce an interface to replace the myUI field or, event better, use an event
system like https://vaadin.com/wiki/-/wiki/main/Events+and+contexts[CDI events]
to completely decouple the components. We'll leave that out of this tutorial for
simplicity.

== Connecting the form to the application

In this part we'll use the CustomerForm class, which we just created in the
previous step, from the MyUI class. We will use it for both editing existing
customers and creating new ones.

In the previous part we already added the form to the _MyUI_ to see how it looks
like. By default we want it to be invisible, so let's first hide it by default
by adding this line to the _init_ method of MyUI class:

[source,java]
----
form.setVisible(false);
----

To edit the customer chosen from the Grid add following selection listener to
the end of the _init_ method:

[source,java]
----
grid.addSelectionListener(event -> {
    if (event.getSelected().isEmpty()) {
        form.setVisible(false);
    } else {
        Customer customer = (Customer) event.getSelected().iterator().next();
        form.setCustomer(customer);
    }
});
----

In the listener we simply take the Customer object of the selected row and it to
the CustomerForm for editing. In previous step we added a side effect to
_setCustomer_ method that will bind the domain object to corresponding fields
and make it visible. If the selection is empty, we'll hide the form.

To allow users also to create new customer records, we'll create a simple "Add
customer button" to the top of the UI, right next to the _filtering_ composition
we have already built from CssLayout, TextField and a Button. Introduce the new
Button with a click listener, by adding following lines to the _init_ method,
right after where you introduced the _filtering_ composition:

[source,java]
----
Button addCustomerBtn = new Button("Add new customer");
addCustomerBtn.addClickListener(e -> {
    grid.select(null);
    form.setCustomer(new Customer());
});
----

In the click listener we first clear a possible selection from the grid and then
instantiate a new Customer object and pass that to the form for editing.

To add it beside our _filtering_ composition, we can use a HorizontalLayout to
create a toolbar where we place both components. First, introduce a toolbar like
this after the previously created _addCustomerBtn_:

[source,java]
----
HorizontalLayout toolbar = new HorizontalLayout(filtering, addCustomerBtn);
toolbar.setSpacing(true);
----

And, again, *replace* the line that populates your main layout to add the
toolbar instead of just the filtering composition, which we just moved to the
_toolbar_ layout.

[source,java]
----
layout.addComponents(toolbar, main);
----

All planned features are now done. You can save the changes and play around with
the application. If something went wrong, can also download an example of
https://github.com/mstahv/t[the final application] and see what went wrong.

== It works! What next?

Congratulations! Users can now create, read, update and delete customer records
stored in the demo backend and you have completed creating your first CRUD UI
with Vaadin.

If you are an experienced Java developer, you are probably already full of ideas
how you can use your existing skills and create new shiny web UIs for your
existing Java apps. If you want more ideas how to create full stack
applications, you might for example go through
http://spring.io/guides/gs/crud-with-vaadin/[Creating CRUD UI with Vaadin] guide
and create a bit similar UI with a real database backend implemented with Spring
Data JPA. We have also collected couple of other excellent resources for a good
start on your Vaadin developer career.
